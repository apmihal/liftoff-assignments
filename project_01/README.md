# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview

As the host of a comedy open mic, I found it difficult to manage the chaos of
keeping track of the order of dozens of comics with just a pen and a piece
paper. People often drop in late, text you to sign  up before they arrive, or
drop out unexpectedly. Sometimes a show can lull because you have too many
inexperienced comics in a row, and you want to easily rearrange the order to put
a more experienced comic in to keep the show going.

In order to solve those problems I plan to create a website that easily allows
for a list of performers to be created and rearranged.

## Features
Easily Managed Lists: Allow users to create lineups for their shows, easily
    drop in performers at any slot, and rearrange them as they see fit.

Show History: Allow users to see the lineups of their previous shows, and to
    allow them to begin building the lineup of future shows.

Cross Off a Performer: Allow users to easily designate and distinguish between
    a performer that has already performed, and ones waiting to perform.

User Login: Allow users to log in to manage the list of their current show,
    look at lists from their previous shows, and manage future shows.

## Technologies

Java

Thymeleaf

Spring Boot

Hibernate

MySQL

JavaScript

## What I'll Have to Learn

To complete this project I'll have to learn more about front-end web development
in order to make the features of this website more user-friendly than pen and
paper. In particular, I believe learning more about JavaScript will help
accomplish this goal.
